// Waits on the main thread for a request of the panel session while keeping Sally painted:
//  - the parent window is disabled (so the user cannot start another command) and shows the wait cursor,
//  - messages are pumped like the FTP plugin does,
//  - after about one second the Sally "safe wait window" appears (with a Close button),
//  - ESC (when one of our windows is in front) or the Close button calls session.Cancel() and the function waits
//    up to two more seconds for the session to acknowledge,
//  - a host key / password question from the session thread is shown through HandleInteraction (the wait window is
//    hidden meanwhile).
// 'text' is shown in the wait window. Everything is restored on every exit path. Never throws.
// Not reentrant: IsWaiting() tells whether a wait is already running (a second one must not be started).
