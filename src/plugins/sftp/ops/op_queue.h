// The work list of one operation (pure model: no threads of its own, no network, no Sally).
//
// An operation (copy/move/...) starts with a few root items (the selected files and directories). A worker takes one
// item, does it, and reports the result. A directory is first an "explore" item; exploring it replaces it with one item
// per entry. Every item belongs to a parent (parentUid, 0 = the operation itself).
//
// Directories that must do something AFTER their content (a move deletes the source directory) are "delayed" items:
//   Delayed       -> some child is still waiting or running
//   Waiting       -> all children are done, now the directory's own action runs (e.g. delete the empty directory)
//   ForcedToFail  -> no child is waiting any more, but at least one was skipped, failed or needs the user: the
//                    directory's own action must NOT run. It is not a failure of its own.
// The state changes ripple up the parents (a ForcedToFail directory can make its Delayed parent ForcedToFail too) and
// back down again when the user retries or solves a child.
//
// Thread safety: ONE mutex guards everything. Every public method takes it, does a short piece of work and returns;
// no method calls out (no callbacks, no libssh2, no Sally) while the lock is held. Methods that hand out items return
// COPIES, never pointers or references into the queue, because other threads change the queue at any time.
// In the lock order (operations list -> operation -> queue -> worker) the queue lock is a leaf for this class.
