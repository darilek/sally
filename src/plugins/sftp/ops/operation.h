// One copy/move run: the queue, the worker threads and the statistics. Sally-free; the UI layer watches it through an
// IOperationObserver and reads State()/Summary()/Statistics().
//
// Life of an operation:  construct (roots go into the queue) -> SetObserver -> Start -> workers run -> the queue has no
// more work (OperationState != Running) -> OnFinished (once per run) -> RequestCancel (or the destructor) ends the
// workers.
//
// Runs. The workers stay alive (idle, without a connection) when the work has run out, so the user can solve parked
// items or retry failed ones afterwards: they become Waiting again, the idle workers wake up and the operation is
// Running again (a new "run"). OnFinished fires once per run, WaitFinished/IsFinished describe the current run. After
// RequestCancel the operation is finished for good. Use Solve/RetryAllFailed below (or CQueue's own, the result is the
// same: the observer just hears about the state change a little later).
//
// Pause. Pause() makes every transfer stop at its next progress callback (like a cancel: the session is closed, the
// item goes back to Waiting and keeps the size it has), and the workers take no new item until Resume(). The operation
// state stays Running and IsPaused() is true. Resume() wakes the workers; they reconnect and continue the partial files.
//
// Interactions. A worker that meets an unknown host key or a prompt publishes it (see TryGetInteraction) and waits for
// AnswerHostKey/AnswerPrompt; one interaction at a time. Without an observer, with settings.interactive == false, after
// a cancel, or when the operation is destroyed, the answer is "reject".
//
// The destructor cancels and joins everything, so a COperation can be destroyed at any time, but NOT from inside an
// observer callback (a worker thread would then wait for itself).
//
// Lock order: operations list -> operation -> queue -> worker. COperation's own mutexes are leaves around plain data;
// none is held while the observer, a worker or libssh2 is called (the queue is called under mutex_ in two places: it
// never calls out).
