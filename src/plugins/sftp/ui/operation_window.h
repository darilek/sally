// The operation window: a modeless dialog on its OWN thread that shows one COperation (progress, speed, items with
// problems) and lets the user pause, cancel, retry and answer the questions workers ask (host key, prompts).
//
// Who owns whom
//   COperationWindowHost::Create builds the operation AND its host. The host is the operation's IOperationObserver (the
//   "bridge": workers call it, it posts messages to the window and returns). The returned shared_ptr<COperation> keeps
//   the host alive through its deleter, so the observer pointer inside the operation can never dangle, no matter who
//   holds the operation (operations list, window, ...). The host holds only a raw pointer to the operation; that is
//   valid because the deleter closes the window (joins its thread) BEFORE it destroys the operation:
//       last shared_ptr<COperation> released -> host->Shutdown() (answers open questions "reject", joins the window
//       thread) -> ~COperation (cancels and joins the workers; may still call the bridge, which only posts or rejects)
//       -> the deleter's copy of the host is released.
//   (C# analogy: the operation's Dispose first disposes the window that watches it.) The deleter must not run on the
//   window thread itself; the window thread never holds a shared_ptr<COperation>, so it cannot.
//
// Order of use:  Create -> operation->Start() -> host->Show().  Show before Start works as well: a question that arrives
//   while the window thread is still starting is kept until the window exists. A question that arrives while NO window
//   exists (closed, or after Shutdown) is answered "reject" at once so the worker never waits for nobody.
//
// Threads: Show/Hide/Close/Shutdown are for the main thread (or any thread other than the window thread). The observer
//   callbacks come from workers at any time. The window thread is the only one that touches the window and the list.
//   Locks: mutex_ guards only the window handle and two flags; it is a leaf (taken for a PostMessage, never held while
//   calling the operation, the SDK or a dialog). lifecycleMutex_ serializes Show/Hide/Close and is held while joining
//   the window thread; the window thread never takes it.
